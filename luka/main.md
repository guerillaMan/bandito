# The play
1. Luka (soldado) meets you on the beach walkway, offers drugs
2. If you don't buy, he'll offer a sample (e.g. burn one on the beach, decriminalized here on possession fyi)
3. Luka will create casual conversation and attempt different techniques to gain trust
- Example: Leaving belongings like a shitty phone or bag of drugs
4. Luka will use his phone at random times to activate his team
5. Kid A (vapor) (unidentified) will pull up & offer cigarettes
  - Detail: Kid will stand to one side (usually opposite Luka). This is intentional as it allows them to control your line of sight
6. Luka offers women, deny, more texting
7. Conversation continues
8. Crazy situation occurs, Luka checks it out, asks you to look after bag
9. Kid A comes near, starts eyeing bag, attempts to strike conversation
10. Inclination is to protect bag for Luka until he returns
11. Luka returns, with Kid B (another vapor; looks fast) who was involved in the altercation, and pretends to walk back
12. Kid B attempts snatch
13. Luka "runs" them off and attempts to help you look for it
14. Luka says to use the light on your phone to look for it (likely for the phone snatch)
15. Kid A returns wondering what was happening (ready for another snatch)
